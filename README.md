PHP FreeAgent API v2 Wrapper
============================

Wrapper for version 2 of the FreeAgent REST API. This wrapper was originally
built for a number of ecommerce shops that I ran that use the FreeAgent
service for it's accounting.

Rather than just use the code that is being used on those sites (which is heavily coupled to VirtueMart or OpenCart) I decided to do a **complete re-write**.

Also the library I built thats in production made use of a 3rd party OAuth2 lib but I'm wanting to replace it with my own implementation here.

Therefore: Very much still **in development**.
